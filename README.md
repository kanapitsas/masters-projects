# Projects
Here are some projects I did for my master's degree (from most to least recent).

## Internship
My internship at Airbus validated my degree. I used a VAE to automate anomaly detection in Aerodynamic Data. The [report](airbus_internship.pdf) contains all the details.

## Second year
- NeuralNetwork : a jupyter notebook where I make a fully-connected neural network from scratch.
- C++ : a selection a exercises from the C++ course.
- DeepLearning/fashion-mnist : exploring the fashion-mnist dataset and the influence of hyper-parameters (Tensorflow)
- Heart : looking at a dataset about heart failure.

## First year
- K-means : implementing the k-means algorithm and applying it to Iris and MNIST (this was in my first year, I did not know much about data science, this might show)
