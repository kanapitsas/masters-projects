# Projects
Here are some projects I did for my master's degree (from most to least recent).
## Second year
- NeuralNetwork : a jupyter notebook where I make a fully-connected neural network from scratch.
- C++ : a selection a exercises from the C++ course.
- DeepLearning/fashion-mnist : exploring the fashion-mnist dataset and the influence of hyper-parameters (Tensorflow)

## First year
- K-means : implementing the k-means algorithm and applying it to Iris and MNIST (this was in my first year, I did not know much about data science, this might show)
