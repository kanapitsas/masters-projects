Some projects I did for my master's degree :
- NeuralNetwork : a jupyter notebook where I make a fully-connected jupyter notebook from scratch.
- K-means : implementing the k-means algorithm and applying it to Iris and MNIST (this was in my first year, I did not know much about data science, this might show)
