# K-means

This is a project I did with Rahma Bourredjem in the first year of my Master's. I wrote the code and did the practical part. The files are :
- `kmeans.py` : main algorithm and helper functions.
- `kmeans_iris.py` : specific to the iris dataset, which is stored in `iris.data`.
- `kmeans_digits.py` : specific to the digits dataset, stored in `optdigits.tes` and `optdigits.tra` ((source)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/optical+recognition+of+handwritten+digits])
- `Rapport_K-means.pdf` : our paper on the algorithm.
