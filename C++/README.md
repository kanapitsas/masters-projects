Here are some things I made during the C++ course :
- `2048_arithmetic` : implementing basic arithmetics on 2048 bits integers.
- `CardinalityCounter` : counts how many times a given objects was inserted, in constant time.
- `DirectedGraph` : basic implementation of graphs
- `Dijkstra` : dijkstra algorithm using `DirectedGraph`.
- `DynamicArray` : array of Double with dynamic memory allocation.
